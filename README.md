            Available online, this is the second edition, updated, and the copyright to it is expired. This is the book that inspired much of permaculture, and is still the reference when it comes to tree agriculture.

            Permaculture Design Course Handbook by Robyn Francis. The course is intended for Certificate III & IV in Horticulture in the Australian education system, comparable to EQF 4 and 5 in Europe. It lays the foundations for permaculture design philosophy and competencies in design work and teaching at the level of designers and teachers in training, working under tutelage of experienced colleagues. It forms the basis for further education and growth in competencies and proficiency of a two year diploma pathway in many European permaculture education systems.

             The goal of this project is to create a wiki-based collective open-source Permaculture Designer Manual, that anyone can enrich and report from learning experiences. Free for all, gardeners, designers, farmers, activists, teachers, and students as well as all curious, can share and apply this knowledge in their own community. We also aim to connect people and information, and facilitate exchanges about permaculture, sustainability, environmentalism, green building, organic gardening and farming. In this wiki-based free manual, "permaculture" is considered in its largest meaning, mainly as an agricultural base for human habitats, but also including other aspects of life : construction, energy, manufacturing, economy, community organization..

             The Apios Institute's mission is to share experience and knowledge about perennial crop polyculture systems for all climates, through a collaborative network of farmers, gardeners, and researchers, in order to fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the design and management of these systems. The apiosinstitute.org website is the main tool through which the organization seeks to achieve this mission. The core of this website is designed as a wiki-like environment where users from around the world can learn about perennial crop polycultures and contribute their own experiences to enrich the site.

             This is an amazing resource of old copyright free books. There are, for example, some great russian books (in english) on plant structure and microbial effects and all sorts of topics which you’d have a hard time finding in popular books today. However, it is quite a large time investment to read them.

            This is a companion piece to “Stabilizing the Climate with ‘Permanent Agriculture‘,” an article that appeared in the Spring 2011 issue of the Permaculture Activist. That article laid out the potential for perennial farming systems like agroforestry and perennial crops to sequester carbon while providing multiple social and ecological benefits. This article reviews perennial staple crops, a little-known group of species with tremendous potential to address world problems.

             These videos are documents from two design courses taught by Bill Mollison at the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center in Glen Rose Texas in 1994 and 1995. They are a definitive selection from our original 16 part series. These tapes bear many viewings and will benefit anyone who wants to learn how to help regenerate the earth - from back yard to bio-region. Teachers of permaculture have found these tapes to be a valuable coaching tool - edited to one hour.
