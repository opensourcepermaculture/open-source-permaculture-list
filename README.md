            Available online, this is the second edition, updated, and the copyright to it is expired. This is the book that inspired much of permaculture, and is still the reference when it comes to tree agriculture.

            Permaculture Design Course Handbook by Robyn Francis. The course is intended for Certificate III & IV in Horticulture in the Australian education system, comparable to EQF 4 and 5 in Europe. It lays the foundations for permaculture design philosophy and competencies in design work and teaching at the level of designers and teachers in training, working under tutelage of experienced colleagues. It forms the basis for further education and growth in competencies and proficiency of a two year diploma pathway in many European permaculture education systems.

             This is an amazing resource of old copyright free books. There are, for example, some great russian books (in english) on plant structure and microbial effects and all sorts of topics which you’d have a hard time finding in popular books today. However, it is quite a large time investment to read them.

            This is a companion piece to “Stabilizing the Climate with ‘Permanent Agriculture‘,” an article that appeared in the Spring 2011 issue of the Permaculture Activist. That article laid out the potential for perennial farming systems like agroforestry and perennial crops to sequester carbon while providing multiple social and ecological benefits. This article reviews perennial staple crops, a little-known group of species with tremendous potential to address world problems.
